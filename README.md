# MiniShell

The objective of this project is to create a simple shell, referred to as MiniShell. The MiniShell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with their operating system by executing commands and managing processes.

## Features

The MiniShell project aims to implement the following features:

1. Command Execution: Users can enter commands in the MiniShell, and the shell will execute them by launching corresponding processes.

2. Basic Command Support: The shell should support executing basic commands available in the operating system, such as running executables, navigating directories, and manipulating files.

3. Process Management: The shell should be able to manage processes, including launching new processes, monitoring their execution, and handling signals (e.g., Ctrl+C).

4. Input/Output Redirection: Users should have the ability to redirect input and output streams of commands, allowing for file input/output and pipeline functionality.

5. Command History: The shell should maintain a command history, allowing users to recall and execute previously entered commands.

6. Environment Variables: Support for environment variables, such as setting and accessing them within the shell.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by the desire to learn more about operating systems, process management, and command-line interfaces. It builds upon the foundations of shell programming and aims to provide a simplified version of a shell environment.
